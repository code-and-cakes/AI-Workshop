  `Senator Cory Booker has set a new record for the longest speech in the history of the U.S. Senate, speaking for over 25 hours to protest the policies of President Donald Trump and Elon Musk. Unlike Strom Thurmond's 1957 filibuster against the Civil Rights Act, Booker's marathon address was not a filibuster but highlighted issues such as potential GOP spending cuts and threats to democracy. Beginning at 7 p.m. on Monday and concluding at 8:05 p.m. on Tuesday, his speech attracted significant attention and praise from over 80 former campaign staff members for its message against fear and division. Throughout the session, he was supported by Democratic colleagues who participated by asking questions to help him maintain the floor. This act has been viewed as a rallying cry for future political endeavors, with prominent Democrats standing in solidarity with Booker. Despite the physical challenge, Booker expressed gratitude and emotional fulfillment, emphasizing the importance of standing up for American values.`,
  `U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty against Luigi Mangione, accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in what has been described as a 'premeditated, cold-blooded assassination' and an act of political violence. Mangione faces both federal and state charges, with the federal case potentially leading to the death penalty and the state charges potentially resulting in a life sentence. This marks the first time the Justice Department has pursued the death penalty since President Donald Trump took office, overturning a federal execution moratorium. The case has sparked significant debate; some view Mangione as a folk hero protesting high healthcare costs, while others see Bondi’s decision as an example of Trump’s tough-on-crime policies. Critics argue that the justice system is biased due to Thompson’s high-profile status, while supporters commend the decision as a necessary step to curb violent crime.`,

  `Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national living in Maryland, was mistakenly deported to El Salvador despite having legal protection against deportation due to safety concerns. The Trump administration admitted the deportation was an 'administrative error,' but claims it cannot retrieve him from the El Salvadoran prison where he is now held. Abrego Garcia's family and lawyers dispute allegations of his gang ties, which the U.S. government used to justify his deportation, and they are suing for his return. The case has sparked criticism of the administration's deportation practices and raised concerns about due process violations, as Abrego Garcia was deported without legal proceedings. His family is demanding action to bring him back to the U.S., but the government argues it lacks the jurisdiction to intervene with the Salvadoran authorities.`,
